# Date timer on React
For this project I used:
* __HTML__
* __CSS__
* __SCSS__
* __JS__
* __React__

## Features
This site is responsive with using localStorage. \
In this application, you can choose a date that will be or has already been and the countdown will start in the format `dd/hh/mm/ss`.
There is also handling of situations when the user sends an empty form or the current date, after which the error block is called. \
